# ExtendedLateCompany

This is a forked version of the original LateCompany aiming at fixing the bugs and adding new features to the original.

Lets players join you after the game has started.

If the in-game invite menu is not working, then the steam overlay menu should work for inviting your friends!

# Info

Bugs that are already fixed and im aiming to fix.

Late joiners have the name "Unknown" (current fix only applies to players who has the mod installed)

Late joiners might appear invisible  (current fix only applies to players who has the mod installed)

Lobby gets removed from the list after game has started

Players sometimes unable to join even when the lobby is not full (in some rare cases this can happen)

Lobby shows the correct amount of players present in the lobby on the list (only partial fix)
