# ExtendedLateCompany

This is a forked version of the original LateCompany aiming at fixing the bugs and adding new features to the original.

Lets players join you after the game has started.

If the in-game invite menu is not working, then the steam overlay menu should work for inviting your friends!

Huge thanks to the original creator of the mod - https://github.com/ANormalTwig/
Thanks Chuxiaaaa for FixPlayerNamePatch
