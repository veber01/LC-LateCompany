# v1.0.1

- An attemt to fix players having the name "Unknown" when joining in late. It does work but in some edge cases it still produces "Unknown" name in the chat (when someone who joined in late and then leaves it'll say in chat that "Unkown" has left)


# v1.0.0

- The lobby should not show up on the lobby list after the game has started or the lobby is full, and it should be visible once in orbit and the lobby is not full.
