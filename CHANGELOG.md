# v1.0.2

- After the game has started and the lobby was reopened it wasnt properly showing the amount of players present in the lobby. It should be fixed and should show up properly.
- Also modified some other stuff.

# v1.0.1

- Added a logic to try to fix players having the name "Unknown" when joining in late.


# v1.0.0

- The lobby should not show up on the lobby list after the game has started or the lobby is full, and it should be visible once in orbit and the lobby is not full.
